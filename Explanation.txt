Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j 
equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

Input Description:
First line contains, n tha size of 2D matrix. (2<n<1000)
Rest line contains, nx2 points as integers in matrix

Output Description:
Print the number of boomerangs.

Sample Input:
3
0 0

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
